Our team has been working on AI for cryptography for the past 4 years. Our team includes researchers and engineers with strong machine learning and cryptography backgrounds. Some of our previous publications include:

* [The cool and the cruel: separating hard parts of LWE secrets](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/443.pdf)
* [SALSA FRESCA: Angular Embeddings and Pre-Training for ML Attacks on Learning With Errors](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/150)
* [SALSA VERDE: a machine learning attack on LWE with sparse small secrets](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/a75db7d2ee1e4bee8fb819979b0a6cad-Abstract-Conference.html)
* [Salsa Picante: A Machine Learning Attack on LWE with Binary Secrets](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3576915.3623076)
* [SALSA: Attacking Lattice Cryptography with Transformers](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/e28b3369186459f57c94a9ec9137fac9-Paper-Conference.pdf)
